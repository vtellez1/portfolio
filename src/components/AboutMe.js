         <p>Hi, my name is <Title>Vanessa Tellez.</Title> I am a full-stack web developer based in <p><span style={{color: "crimson"}}><i class="fas fa-map-pin"></i></span> Charlotte, NC</p></p>
        </AboutTop> 
         <p>I was one of those kids that loved school because I love learning something new everyday. It isnâ€™t practical to stay in school forever so I found the next best thing and became a developer! I'm passionate about continuous learning and enjoy problem solving. I'm excited to apply my skills to impactful projects and learn as much as possible along the way.</p>

        <p>
        When I'm not in front of my computer, I enjoy hiking the Carolina mountains, reading, visiting new coffee shops (cold brews and dirty chai's all the way), and spending time with my family.
